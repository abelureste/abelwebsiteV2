      <h5>Why make a home lab?</h5>
      <p>It's simple, I wanted to practice what I've been learning in my networking and cybersecurity classes. I figured the best way to become familiar with manipulating computers over a network is to make my own network. Over the course of a few months, I did lots of forum searching to research what hardware and software people were using for their personal homelabs. I then took note of what hardware people were using, and being a student, I wanted to do this whole project in an attainable budget.</p>
      <h5>Hardware</h5>
      <p>Components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Asus RT-AX1800S Router</li>
        <li>Netgear 5 Port Gigabit Switch</li>
        <li>2x 4GB Ram Raspberry Pi 5 with NVMe hats and 256gb NVMe drives</li>
        <li>Dell Optiplex 3070 9100T 8</li>
        <li>3D Printed Rack with Custom Mounts for Hardware</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Starting with the router, this is something I already had and while the CPU can be quite slow and the RAM amount is quite low, it works for now and is yet to be a bottleneck. Next, the gigabit switch is a hand-me-down from a friend that no longer needed it. It works and it was free so its a no brainer to implement. Finally, the computers. I decided to start off with two raspberry pis, which work well as low power computers that can run processes or scripts for me 24/7 and not make a big impact on my electric bill. Instead of using the microSD slots, I wanted NVMe drives to for faster, more reliable storage. I installed NVMe boards by mounting them to the Pis with 3D printed custom mounts and standoffs so they didn't interfere with my rack. After tinkering with the pis for a bit, I ordered a used Dell Optiplex 3070 micro off of eBay to be a dedicated Proxmox computer. I created a Proxmox instance because I wanted to learn more about working natively in Linux environments, and work with penetration testing software embedded with Kali Linux. I also have began to work with containerization, which is extremely easy to set up in Proxmox. </p>
